# Gun-Violence-USA

## About

The goal of this project (which is an multi-step group assignment for our I 310D: Introduction to Human-Centered Data Science class) was to explore and analyze a dataset of our choice. The group is made up of Agnaeya Arora, Rosalyn Lu, Shikha Mehta, and Fiona Romanoschi. For this assignment, we examined the [Gun Violence, USA](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nidzsharma/us-mass-shootings-19822023) dataset from Kaggle and determined relationships between the included columns of case, location, location type, date, summary, fatalities, injured, total victims, age of shooter, and prior signs of mental health issues, and the added data of state political affiliation and population using k-means clustering and t-SNE analyses. We created a project proposal plan, a three-minute project talk pitch, [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/rosalynlu/Gun-Violence-USA) to host our code, a [final presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1syWisYWgYcMs4My2vANAyp__1xFKhCtWYZkA6ILZFBI/edit?usp=sharing), and a final report regarding our findings, all as submitted and graded assignments.
